# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Troy Samuels
- **What to call them:** Troy
- **Pronouns:** *(not specified)*
- **Timezone:** Europe/London

## Context

**Communication style:** Explain things as if Troy is non-technical, but he's learning fast. Start simple, then layer in technical details over time to help build understanding. Avoid jargon dumps, but don't dumb things down permanently — he wants to level up.

**Current projects:**
- PropFlow AI — SaaS for short-term rental management (Python backend, considering Supabase for DB)

**Preferences:**
- Auto-switch models based on task complexity, but notify when switching

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
