### Social Media Blitz (Hour 2)

**Twitter/X Thread**:
```
🚨 I just discovered something shocking about online tutoring platforms.

A thread on the hidden "platform tax" every tutor pays: 🧵

1/ I built a calculator to show tutors their REAL platform costs.

The average tutor pays $8,000+ per year in fees. That's 2 months of work... for FREE.

2/ Take Sarah, a Spanish tutor:
• 20 hours/week at $25/hour
• Gross: $26,000/year
• Platform takes: $4,680/year  
• That's 9 weeks of unpaid labor

3/ Here's what broke my heart:

Sarah could afford a family vacation, emergency fund, or car payment with that money.

Instead? It goes to platform shareholders.

4/ So I built this calculator to show tutors their exact "platform tax":

[calculator-link]

It takes 30 seconds. The results will shock you.

5/ If you know any tutors, please share this.

They deserve to know where their money really goes.

💡 Industry Analysis: The Hidden Cost of Platform Dependency in Language Education

After analyzing 500+ tutor profiles, I discovered something concerning about our industry.

The average language tutor pays $7,200 annually in platform fees - money that could fund:
• Professional development: $2,400
• Emergency fund: $2,400  
• Business growth: $2,400

I built a calculator to help educators understand their real costs:
[calculator-link]

Key insights:
🔸 Platform commissions range from 15-33%
🔸 Additional processing fees add 2-3%
🔸 Average tutor works 8 weeks/year for FREE

For fellow language educators: knowledge is power. Understanding your real costs enables better business decisions.

What surprised me most? Even "low" 15% commissions add up to thousands annually.

### Strategic Community Seeding (Hours 3-4)

Target these subreddits with value-first posts:

**r/OnlineESLTeaching**:
```
Title: "PSA: Calculate your platform fees before it's too late"

I just built a calculator that shows how much we're really paying to platforms.

My results: $6,800/year to iTalki. That's 13 weeks of teaching... for free.

Platform commission: 15%
Payment processing: 2.9%
Effective loss: ~18% of gross income

The breakdown:
- Monthly gross: $2,000
- Platform takes: $360/month
- Annual loss: $4,320

But here's what hurt: That money could cover my health insurance for the year.
