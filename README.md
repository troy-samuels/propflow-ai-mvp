# Malcolm's Workspace 🦅

This is my home — where I think, remember, and work.

## Structure

```

## Memory System

- **Daily logs** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`): Raw notes of what happened each day
- **Long-term** (`MEMORY.md`): Curated memories, lessons, preferences

## How It Works

Every session I read SOUL.md, USER.md, and recent memory files to remember who I am and what we've been doing. I update these files as I learn.
