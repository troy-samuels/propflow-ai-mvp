## 📝 Entry Strategy Templates

### **Facebook Group Introduction**
```
Hi everyone! 👋 

New to the group and excited to connect with fellow language teachers. I've been helping tutors transition from platforms to independent teaching.

Quick question: What's your biggest challenge with student retention? I've found some strategies that work really well and happy to share.

Looking forward to learning from this amazing community!

Title: "Platform vs Independent Teaching: Real Income Breakdown"

Body: After 3 years on [Platform], I helped dozens of tutors go independent. Here's what the numbers actually look like:

Platform: $20/hr - 25% fee = $15/hr take-home
Independent: $25/hr - 0% fee = $25/hr take-home

The difference? $5,200/year for a part-time tutor.

Happy to share the transition strategies that worked. What questions do you have?
```

### **LinkedIn Post**
```
🎓 Language teaching independence is growing.

After analyzing 100+ tutor transitions from platforms to independent practice, here's what I learned:

✅ 67% increased their hourly rate
✅ 89% improved student retention  
✅ 78% reported higher job satisfaction

The key? Building direct relationships vs. platform dependency.

What's driving this shift in our industry?
